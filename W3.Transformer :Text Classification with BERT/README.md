"🎬 BERT for IMDb Sentiment Classification"
📌 Overview

This project implements a sentiment classification model using a Transformer-based architecture (BERT) to classify movie reviews from the IMDb dataset as positive or negative.

The goal is to leverage pre-trained language models to achieve high accuracy in natural language understanding tasks.

🎯 Objectives
Build a sentiment analysis model using BERT (Transformer)
Classify IMDb movie reviews into:
Positive 😊
Negative 😞
Achieve ≥ 85% accuracy on the test dataset
